# Introduction
Responsible code development is not a byproduct of good programmers.
It is a paradigm of development in and of itself. It is this paradigm that shapes
the modern programmer, the weight on which it lays can be seen in the software issues of the past.
The Therac-25, a machine with software that had not been scrutinized, leading to deaths. The 2012 Knight Capital incident
leading to losses of millions because issues stemming from integrating changes into an old system. The Y2K incident
spreading panic among civilians based on the idea that the internal clocks of old systems would not be able to represent
the year 2000 causing system failures. All of these, are grounded on the limited role reliability played in past system development.
To resolve these, we have shaped various procedures to underline our development. One of these is continuous integration.

When developer make rapid changes as they have to do during team development 
they inadvertently introduce many issues to the stability and quality of the shared code base.

Continuous integration is the process of enabling developers to still make rapid changes to an existing code base while sustaining
code reliability. This is done through two main strategy, the first is running tests on changes and the second is 
depending on the results of these tests controlling the actual change made to the shared code base.
