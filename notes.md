We will divide CI into two concepts:

# Tests
    There are many ways to test a program, tests are what makes modern continuous integration.
    For example, we cannot assure that all small changes due not cause some catastrophic change if we do
    not test it and we have manual vs automatic tests.

# Work control
    There are ways to organize our work flow such that we can effectively use continuous integration.
    For example, having a feature and main branch where any merges are controlled by our tests.
