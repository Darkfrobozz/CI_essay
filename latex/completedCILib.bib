	abstract = {While everyone knows the theoretical limitations of software testing, in practice we devote considerable effort to this task and would consider it foolish or downright dangerous to skip it. Other verification techniques such as static analysis, model checking, and proofs have great potential, but none is ripe for overtaking tests as the dominant verification technique. This makes it imperative to understand the scope and limitations of testing and perform it right. The principles that follow emerged from experience studying software testing and developing automated tools such as AutoTest.},

	abstract = {Employing lightweight, tool-based code review of code changes (aka modern code review) has become the norm for a wide variety of open-source and industrial systems. In this paper, we make an exploratory investigation of modern code review at Google. Google introduced code review early on and evolved it over the years; our study sheds light on why Google introduced this practice and analyzes its current status, after the process has been reﬁned through decades of code changes and millions of code reviews. By means of 12 interviews, a survey with 44 respondents, and the analysis of review logs for 9 million reviewed changes, we investigate motivations behind code review at Google, current practices, and developers’ satisfaction and challenges.},
